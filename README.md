# Instant Yield Lending Protocol
This protocol is designed to address the challenge of needing immediate funds without the desire to sell assets or resort to loans. Users contribute capital, which is securely locked, and in return, they receive instant access to their desired amount of money. The locked capital is deposited into a lending platform through smart contracts, generating a constant Annual Percentage Yield (APY) that serves as compensation for the requested sum. This capital remains locked until it accumulates sufficient returns to cover the desired amount. 
Perfect for lenders seeking immediate liquidity without relinquishing asset ownership or incurring interest rates, our protocol offers a unique financial solution in the crypto space, where borrowers still provide collateral for their transactions.
